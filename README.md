Losos is implementation of [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) language in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

## Goals

- Python implementation should be as close as possible to Java version in book ([see below](#differences))

- [ ] Losos 1.0 - working Python implementation of tree-walk interpreter
- [ ] Losos 1.x - extend Losos so next goals are possible
- [ ] Losos 2.0 - bytecode compiler written in Lox itself
- [ ] Use v1.x to run v2.0 to compile v2.0 source to bytecode
- [ ] Losos VM written in C++
